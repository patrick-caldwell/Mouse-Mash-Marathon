# Mouse Mash Marathon

The Mouse Mash Marathon is a progressive web application created with the Ionic Framework (https://ionicframework.com/) and Google's Firebase (https://firebase.google.com/).

The Mouse Mash Marathon is a game where users compete to see who can click their mouse the quickest during a 10 second period. Users can use the available public leaderboard to see how they compare against other players. Clicking on a score on the leaderboard shows more details about the the user and their score.

If a player beats their existing personal best score, they can update their existing score on the leaderboards to reflect their new personal best score. Additionally, if a user feels the need to, they have the ability to delete their score off the leaderboard.
